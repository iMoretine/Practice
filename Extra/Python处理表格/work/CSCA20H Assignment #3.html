      <h1>CSCA20H Assignment 3</h1>
    </div>

<h2>Due: Dec. 4nd, 11:59pm. </h2>

    <p>
    </p>
  
  

<h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        The purpose of this assignment is to give you practice in working
        with databases.
    </p>
 
<h2>Overview</h2>

     <p>
        You will write functions that work with exam timetable data for the UTSC Fall 2017 Final Exams.
               </p>
      
     

<h2>Problem domain</h2>

<p>You will create 3 tables to store the the UTSC final exam timetable information and write queries to retrieve timetable information.
  The tables in the database are outlined below.   In the starter
 file <a href="http://utsc.utoronto.ca/~bretscher/a20/assignments/A3/starter/make_tables.py">make_tables.py</a> complete the functions to make the following tables. 
 You may call the check table functions given to you
  to look at the tables and see if they look correct.   </p>
  
  

<h3>Database table formats</h3>

<p> For each row in  each table, there is an <code>ID</code> field.  This field is is unique for each exam offering.  This means that if two different sections of 
 a course have the same exam time, they will have the same <code>ID</code> even if they have multiple sections and/or instructors. If a 
 course has different <code>ID</code>s then that means that the different sections have different exam schedules. 
 </p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Courses table fields (in this order)</b>:<br><br>

<code>ID (TEXT)</code><br>
<code>Course (TEXT)</code><br>
<code>Sections (TEXT)</code><br>
<code>Name (TEXT)</code> <font color="red">&lt;-- UPDATED Nov. 25</font><br>
</p></li>

where <code>ID</code> refers to a number associated with a particular course and it's associated instructors, <code>Course</code> refers to the course code such as CSCA20H3F,
 <code>Sections</code> refers to the course section such as "LEC01" or "ALL",
<code>Name</code>  is the instructors name with first initial followed by last name such as "A. Bretscher".
<br>

<li><p><b>Time table fields (in this order)</b>:<br><br>

<code>ID (TEXT)</code><br>
<code>Date (TEXT)</code><br>
<code>Start (TEXT)</code> <font color="red">&lt;-- UPDATED Nov. 25</font><br>
<code>End (TEXT)</code> <font color="red">&lt;-- UPDATED Nov. 25</font><br>
<code>Duration (TEXT)</code><br>
</p></li>

where <code>ID</code> refers to a number associated with a particular course and it's associated instructors, 
<code>Date</code> refers to a date "YY-MM-DD" such as "17-12-19",   <code>Start</code> and <code>End</code> refer to the start and end
times of an exam based on the 24 hour clock such as "14:00" and <code>Duration</code> is the length of the exam and is in hours:min format, for example
"3:00" for a 3 hour exam.<br>


<li><p><b>Location table fields (in this order)</b>:<br><br>

<code>ID (TEXT)</code><br>
<code>Room (TEXT)</code><br></p></li><br>

where <code>ID</code> refers to a number associated with a particular course and it's associated instructors, <code>ROOM</code> is the location
of the exam. Note that some <code>ID</code>s will have many rows with different rooms listed. <br>

</ul>
<h2>Table Set Up</h2>

<p>You will need to set up the tables. The input <code>.csv</code> files have the following formats:</p>

<p><a href="http://utsc.utoronto.ca/~bretscher/a20/assignments/A3/starter/courses.csv">courses.csv</a><br>

<code>ID,Course,Sections,First Initial Last Name,First Initial Last Name,...</code><br><br>

Notice that there can be 1 or more course instructors listed. 
</p>


<p><a href="http://utsc.utoronto.ca/~bretscher/a20/assignments/A3/starter/time.csv">time.csv</a><br>

<code>ID,Date,Start Time,End Time,Duration</code>
</p>
<p><a href="http://utsc.utoronto.ca/~bretscher/a20/assignments/A3/starter/locations.csv">locations.csv</a><br>
<code>ID,Room,Room,...</code><br><br>

Notice that there can be 1 or more Rooms listed.
</p>
 
<h2>Making Your Queries</h2>

<p>Using the starter file  <a href="http://utsc.utoronto.ca/~bretscher/a20/assignments/A3/starter/queries.py">queries.py</a>, complete the functions.
 The docstring should be an appropriate rephrasing of the specification given in the starter file. </p>


<p>For each of the functions in the <a href="http://utsc.utoronto.ca/~bretscher/a20/assignments/A3/starter/queries.py">queries.py</a> starter file that ask you to query the database,
    you do not need to format your output unless specified.  I.e., you can just return
    the list of data in the form given by <code>run_query</code>.</p>

<h2>The Program</h2>
<p>Some of the functions required above are to practice writing queries.  A couple of your functions you will use to display a students 
exam time table.  Your program should do the following:</p>

<p>
<code>Please enter your course or return to quit.</code><br><br>

The user can continue to enter courses by answering the prompt:<br><br>

<code>Please enter the next course or return to quit. </code><br><br>

If the user enters an invalid course code your program should ask for the code again:<br><br>

<code>Not a valid course code, please re-enter or return to quit.</code><br><br>

The program should then try to retrieve the exam times. If a course has more than one section, then your program should 
prompt the user for the correct course section code:<br><br>

<code>There are multiple sections of C. What is your section?</code><br><br>

Where <code>C</code> is the course code. <br><br>

Your code should then print out on separate lines:<br><br>

<code>Course C has exam on D at T.</code><br>
 <strong>or </strong><br>
 
<code>Course C section S has exam on D at T.</code> <br><br>

depending on whether the course has multiple sections. <br><br>

For example, a sample final output might be:<br>


<code>Course CSCA20H3F  has exam on 17-12-13 at 14.00.</code><br>
<code>Course MGEB02H3F section LEC01 has exam on 17-12-14 at 14:00.</code><br>

</p>

        

<p></p>

        <p>
            <b>Docstrings</b>: for each function, you should write a docstring comment that describes its parameters, what the function does, and what is returned by the function.
            <b>Comments</b>: for each function you should comment your code explaining what you are doing.</p>

        <p>
          <b>Reuse</b>: in some cases, duplicate code can be avoided by 
          having some of your functions call others.  You should do this
          whenever possible.
        </p>
    <h2>Marking</h2>

    <p>
      Here are some general outlines and explanatory notes: 
    </p>

    <ul>

      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Correctness:</b> your functions should perform as specified.
          Correctness, as measured by our tests, will count for the
          largest single portion of your marks.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Style:</b> Make sure that you  test your code using the pep8 online code checker (see resources page).  It is 
          picky but you will know your style is good once it passes!
        </p>

      </li>
            <li>
        <p>
          <b>Programming style:</b> Your variable names should be meaningful and your code as simple and clear as possible. You should avoid duplicate code by calling other functions within the module as helpers. 
           Your functions should be written so that they would work properly even if different values are used for the constants.
      </p></li><li>
        <p>
          <b>Commenting</b>: for each function, you should write a
          docstring comment that describes its parametres, what the
          function does, and what is returned by the function as well as appropriate examples.
        </p>
      </li>
 <li>
        <p>
          <b>Reuse</b>: in each part, some of the functions that are
          specified in the table can be written by calling other
          functions in that table.  You should do this as much as
          possible.  Whenever you find yourself writing duplicate code you should ask yourself whether that code would be better served in a separate function.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
