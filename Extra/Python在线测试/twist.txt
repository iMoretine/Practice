If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers
Where is the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked

Betty Botter bought some butter
But she said the butter is bitter
If I put it in my batter 
it will make my batter bitter
But a bit of better butter will make my batter better
So it was better Betty Botter bought a bit of better butter

I wish to wish the wish you wish to wish
but if you wish the wish the witch wishes
I won't wish the wish you wish to wish
