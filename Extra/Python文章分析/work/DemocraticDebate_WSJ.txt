Facing a pivotal Democratic primary next week in New York Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed in a debate Thursday in Brooklyn over questions of judgment and their readiness for assuming the presidency
The showdown was one of Sanders last chances to change the trajectory of the primary race and egged on by a boisterous audience he took an aggressive posture often interrupting his rival and talking over the moderators as did Clinton
Sanders hit the Democratic front runner on a variety of familiar fronts: taking direct aim at her ties to Wall Street her past decision making and her more moderate policy agenda
Clinton spent much of the evening talking up her record and that of President Barack Obama She also cast herself as the only real Democrat in the race who has worked to help the party and other candidates
Noting that she has won more votes than Sanders and built a national campaign she said her candidacy is one that will not only capture the Democratic nomination but a campaign that will defeat whoever the Republicans end up nominating
The pair disagreed sharply about Israel with Sanders suggesting Clinton was favoring Israel in its long running dispute with the Palestinians
Long term there will never be peace in that region unless the United States plays a role an evenhanded role he said He said that in addressing the leading US lobby for Israel Clinton hadn’t even discussed the needs of the Palestinian people
Clinton said she does sympathize with Israelis who she said are constantly under terrorist attack saying the nation has a right to defend itself As president though she said she would be fair and cited her work as secretary of state
I’m the person who held the last three meetings between the president of the Palestinian Authority and the prime minister of Israel she said adding there were only four of us in the room
The Vermont senator backed off earlier comments suggesting that the former secretary of state wasn’t qualified to be president but condemned her decisions to vote for the Iraq war and to accept millions of dollars in support from super PACs Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and the intelligence to be a president Of course she does he said But I do question her judgment
Clinton said the senator recent interview with the New York Daily News editorial board revealed a lack of understanding of foreign policy and the financial industry and that Obama selection of her as the nation top diplomat illustrates his faith in her leadership Talk about judgment and talk about the kinds of problems he had answering questions about even his core issues she said I think you need to have the judgment on day one
Sanders came to the ninth Democratic debate in urgent need of a win His path to the nomination has narrowed significantly as Clinton has built a commanding lead in pledged delegates
A loss in Tuesday New York primary would leave Sanders with little hope of catching Clinton and a new Wall Street Journal NBC News Marist poll showed her leading by 17 percentage points among likely New York Democratic primary voters
In the debate Sanders blasted Clinton claim that she can rein in Wall Street banks after accepting fees and campaign donations from these interests Do we really feel confident about a candidate saying she going to bring change in America when she so dependent on big money interests I don’t think so he said
Asked to name an example of where Wall Street money influenced Clinton judgment Sanders cited the decision not to break up the banks after the financial crisis plunged the US into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression
But Clinton who wasn’t in Congress at the time shot back: He cannot come up with any example because there is no example
She said that the legislative response to the banking crisis was the Dodd Frank law passed while she was secretary of state and that as a senator from New York she was critical of the financial sector and called out their bad behavior
Secretary Clinton called them out Sanders replied sarcastically Oh my goodness they must have been really crushed by this He asked if that was before or after she received large payments for speeches to Wall Street firms
Sanders has been pressing her to release transcripts of those speeches Clinton repeated her promise to release her transcripts when all other candidates who gave paid speeches do the same
She also asked Sanders why he hasn’t released his tax returns He said he would release his 2014 return Friday but cautioned that it would be very boring and prove he is one of the least wealthy members of the US Senate
Sanders who is mounting an aggressive effort to court African American voters must cut into the constituency that has vaulted Clinton to a big delegate lead in the Democratic presidential campaign While that is now focused on Tuesday primary it could reverberate in states that will cast ballots a week after New York on April 26
African Americans accounted for more than one third of Democratic voters in Maryland for example during the 2008 primary fight between Clinton and then Sen Barack Obama About 20% of those who cast ballots in the party Pennsylvania primary that year were minorities and about 15% who voted in the New York primary that year were black according to exit polls
In a bid to reintroduce himself Sanders is airing two TV spots in New York featuring prominent African Americans and showcasing endorsements from civil rights activists
He also took aim at former President Bill Clinton over a recent clash with black protesters who objected to the crime and punishment practices in the 1990s It is unclear how effective that tactic may be given that Clinton approval rating among all African Americans is 89% according to a February Wall Street Journal NBC News poll
Pressed during the debate Clinton said she was sorry for some of the unexpected ramifications of the crime bill saying they had unfortunate impact on families Sanders also supported the legislation
The two candidates then shifted to a caustic exchange over gun control laws Moderator Wolf Blitzer asked Clinton about her statement on the trail that Vermont with little gun control regulation has per capita the greatest number of guns involved in crimes in New York Was she seriously blaming Vermont for New York gun violence Of course not Clinton said prompting a chuckle from Sanders
It not a laughing matter Clinton said She said Sanders has taken the position that gun makers should be shielded from lawsuits over use of firearms
We hear a lot from Sen Sanders about the greed and recklessness of Wall Street…but what about the greed and recklessness of the gun manufacturers and dealers in America Clinton said
Sanders pressed her on why she made the claim that Vermont bears responsibility for gun violence in New York
The facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from out of state Clinton replied They come from states that don’t have the kind of serious efforts to control guns that we have in New York
Hours before the Brooklyn debate Sanders appeared at the National Action Network convention hosted by the Rev Al Sharpton and said Republican governors around the country are using voter suppression tactics reminiscent of the Jim Crow days
Making inroads into Clinton advantage among African Americans won’t be easy Another Wall Street Journal NBC News Marist poll released earlier this week showed her with a 40 point lead among black Democrats in New York
Clinton built her lead of 251 pledged delegates largely through decisive victories in Deep South states with large black populations states that Sanders largely ignored In Alabama she took 91% of the black vote
An analysis by Public Opinion Strategies a Republican polling firm showed that in 21 states that have already voted she won upward of 77% of African Americans compared with about 22% for Sanders
Hoping to counter Sanders efforts the Clinton campaign held a conference call with three Congressional Black Caucus members on Thursday during which they cast him as a late arrival to issues important to the black community
Rep Hakeem Jeffries who represents parts of New York City said the Vermont senator hasn’t done enough to address the racial disparity in his state prison population Vermont imprisons blacks at nearly 13 times the rate of whites according to data compiled by the Sentencing Project a group that advocates for improvements in the criminal justice system That is among the most pronounced disparities in the country according to the group research
On the issue of criminal justice reform Bernie Sanders has been all talk and no action Jeffries said
Vaughn Carney is an African American attorney in Vermont who said that he has voted for Sanders many times over the years but that Sanders always seemed more comfortable talking about broad issues of economic class and income inequality than about race
His feeling is that economics is the answer and government is the answer and that going to solve all the racial issues said Carney a Clinton supporter I don’t buy that
A Sanders campaign spokesman didn’t respond to a question about Vermont prison population
The Clintons have had decades to forge ties to African Americans first in Arkansas later in the White House and then in Clinton eight years as a senator from New York By contrast Sanders has lived most of his life in a state that is 95% white
Still he says he is well acquainted with the struggles of African Americans At the Thursday event he drew applause when he noted that in 1988 as a mayor in Vermont an almost all white state then he supported Rev Jesse Jackson Democratic presidential bid That wasn’t a popular thing to do he said
Most of Sanders success in the presidential race has come in predominantly white states Some African Americans at Sanders huge rally in Manhattan Washington Square Park Wednesday evening said they couldn’t understand why Sanders hadn’t caught on more with nonwhite voters
He always been on the right side of history said Olivier Plummer 18 years old of New York Queens borough who plans to cast his first ballot for Sanders He carried a sign saying that he supports the Vermont senator because black lives always mattered not just when it became election year
While the candidates are also engaged in a continuing dispute over who has the stronger immigration record an effort to appeal to Latino voters it is in the black community where Sanders has the most work to do One of his TV ads produced by director Spike Lee features prominent civil rights activists endorsing Sanders People of color have a deeply vested interest in what Bernie Sanders brings to us in this election singer Harry Belafonte says A second spot features Erica Garner whose father Eric died in 2014 after a police confrontation on Staten Island His death sparked a series of protests and political turmoil in New York
